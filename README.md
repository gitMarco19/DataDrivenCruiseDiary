# Data Visualization

*Author: Marco Scanu*

## Overview
The aim is to build a narrative tool that tells the story of a sea cruise using the data collected during the cruise. <br>
The challenge is trying to do something that is aesthetically pleasing and strives toward the goal of unfolding a narrative story through the data.
Right now, the project has been realized using a mockup dataset, because the system for collecting data from the ship is not yet live and running. 

Data: a csv file containing time series data for the provided variables.

Vis scope: time series

## User manual
This project is meant to be visualized in a full screen mode with resolution 1920x1080. So, in order to visualize it properly, the browser must be setted in its full screen mode.

## Future development
Optional integration with additional external data. <br>
For example:
- Weather data from external stations.
- Astronomical data (sunset/sunrise, sun height during the day, moon rising/setting and phases).
